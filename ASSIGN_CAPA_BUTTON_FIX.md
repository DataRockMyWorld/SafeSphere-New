# ✅ **"Assign CAPA" Button Fix - COMPLETE!**

## 🎯 **Problem Fixed**

The "Assign CAPA" button in the Findings page detail dialog was not working - it had no `onClick` handler!

---

## 🔧 **Solution Applied**

### **What Was Changed:**

**File:** `frontend/src/components/audit/Findings.tsx`

#### **1. Imported QuickCAPAAssignment Component:**
```typescript
import QuickCAPAAssignment from './QuickCAPAAssignment';
```

#### **2. Added State for CAPA Dialog:**
```typescript
const [capaDialog, setCAPADialog] = useState(false);
```

#### **3. Added Handler Functions:**
```typescript
const handleAssignCAPA = () => {
  setCAPADialog(true);
};

const handleCAPASuccess = () => {
  setCAPADialog(false);
  fetchFindings();  // Refresh findings list
  if (selectedFinding) {
    handleViewDetails(selectedFinding.id);  // Refresh finding details
  }
  showSnackbar('CAPA assigned successfully', 'success');
};
```

#### **4. Added onClick Handler to Button:**
```typescript
<Button 
  variant="contained" 
  startIcon={<CAPAIcon />}
  onClick={handleAssignCAPA}  // ← ADDED THIS!
  sx={{
    background: `linear-gradient(135deg, ${theme.palette.warning.main}, ${theme.palette.error.main})`,
  }}
>
  Assign CAPA
</Button>
```

#### **5. Added QuickCAPAAssignment Component:**
```typescript
{selectedFinding && (
  <QuickCAPAAssignment
    open={capaDialog}
    onClose={() => setCAPADialog(false)}
    onSuccess={handleCAPASuccess}
    finding={{
      id: selectedFinding.id,
      finding_code: selectedFinding.finding_code,
      title: selectedFinding.title,
      finding_type: selectedFinding.finding_type,
      severity: selectedFinding.severity,
      description: selectedFinding.description,
      root_cause_analysis: selectedFinding.root_cause_analysis,
      department_affected: selectedFinding.department_affected,
    }}
  />
)}
```

## 🎨 **Visual Features**

### **Button Styling:**
- 🎨 Gradient background (warning → error colors)

Major NC         → 14 days
Minor NC         → 30 days
Observation      → 60 days
OFI              → 90 days

Finding Severity → CAPA Priority
──────────────────────────────────
CRITICAL         → CRITICAL
HIGH             → HIGH
MEDIUM           → MEDIUM
LOW              → LOW
```
