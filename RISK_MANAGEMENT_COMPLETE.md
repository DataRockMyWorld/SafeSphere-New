## 🎯 **Enhanced Features (Beyond Original Request)**

### **1. Hierarchy of Controls** ⭐
Every barrier classified by effectiveness:
```
1 - Elimination (Most Effective)
2 - Substitution
3 - Engineering Controls
4 - Administrative Controls
5 - PPE (Least Effective)
```

**Why:** ISO 45001 requires demonstrating use of hierarchy

### **2. Barrier Effectiveness Rating** ⭐
Each control rated 1-5:
```
5 - Very High (Highly Effective)
4 - High (Effective)
3 - Medium (Moderately Effective)
2 - Low (Limited Effectiveness)
1 - Very Low (Ineffective)
```

**Why:** Controls on paper ≠ controls in practice

### **3. Exposure Data** ⭐
```
- Number of people exposed
- Frequency of exposure
- Duration of exposure
- Vulnerable groups
```

**Why:** Risk significance depends on exposure (100 people vs 1 person)

### **4. ALARP Demonstration** ⭐
```
- ALARP Required? (Yes/No)
- ALARP Justification
- Management Decision
```

**Why:** Legal defense - demonstrate "reasonably practicable"

### **5. Review Schedule** ⭐
```
Auto-calculated based on risk level:
- High Risk: Quarterly (90 days)
- Medium Risk: Semi-annual (180 days)
- Low Risk: Annual (365 days)
```

**Why:** Ensures high risks are reviewed more frequently

### **6. Compliance Links** ⭐
```
- ISO 45001 Clauses
- Legal Requirements
- Company Procedures
```

**Why:** Demonstrate compliance, audit trail

### **7. Version Control** ⭐
```
- Version Number
- Review History
- Change Tracking
```

**Why:** See how risk evolves over time

### **8. CAPA Integration** ⭐
```
Risk Treatment Action ←→ CAPA
```

**Why:** Close the loop - risk action becomes formal CAPA
