# SafeSphere Stress Testing Strategy

## 🚨 CRITICAL ASSESSMENT

**Current Test Coverage: ~0%**

As a senior developer, I need to be direct: **Your application has virtually no test coverage**. This is a significant risk for a production system handling safety and compliance management. Here's what we need to address immediately:

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. **Authentication & Security** ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY
- Account lockout mechanism untested (could lock out legitimate users or fail to lock out attackers)
- Password reset code generation/validation untested (6-digit codes, 15-minute expiry)
- JWT token handling untested
- Failed login attempt tracking untested
- No rate limiting tests

### 2. **Document Workflow** ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY
- Multi-stage approval workflow untested (DRAFT → HSSE_REVIEW → OPS_REVIEW → MD_APPROVAL → APPROVED)
- State transition validation untested (could allow invalid transitions)
- Permission checks untested (could expose documents to unauthorized users)
- Version control untested (document versioning logic)
- Change request approval flow untested

### 3. **PPE Management** ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY
- Inventory calculations untested (received - issued - damaged - expired)
- Concurrent inventory updates untested (race conditions possible)
- PO number generation untested (could create duplicates)
- Expiry date calculations untested
- Stock level alerts untested

### 4. **Legal Compliance** ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY
- Compliance tracking untested
- Document uploads/archiving untested
- Review cycle calculations untested

### 5. **Data Integrity** ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY
- No cascade delete tests (what happens when users/documents are deleted?)
- No constraint validation tests
- No concurrent modification tests

## Comprehensive Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Unit Tests (Foundation) - Week 1

#### 1.1 Accounts Module
```python
Critical Test Areas:
✓ User creation and validation
✓ Password hashing and verification
✓ Account lockout mechanism (3 failed attempts → lock for X minutes)
✓ Reset code generation (uniqueness, expiry)
✓ Reset code verification (valid/expired/invalid)
✓ Failed login tracking and reset
✓ Notification creation
✓ User permissions by role/position
```

#### 1.2 Documents Module
```python
Critical Test Areas:
✓ Document state transitions (all valid/invalid paths)
✓ Permission checks (edit/review/approve/reject)
✓ Version control (creation, incrementing)
✓ Workflow history tracking
✓ Change request approval/rejection
✓ Template validation
✓ Record approval workflow
```

#### 1.3 PPE Module
```python
Critical Test Areas:

✓ Review cycle calculations
```

### Phase 2: Integration Tests - Week 2

#### 2.1 API Endpoint Tests
```python
For EACH endpoint:
✓ Authentication required
✓ Permission checks (unauthorized access blocked)
✓ Valid input accepted
✓ Invalid input rejected with proper errors
✓ Proper HTTP status codes
✓ Response data structure
✓ Rate limiting (where applicable)
```

#### 2.2 Workflow Integration
```python
✓ End-to-end document approval flow
✓ End-to-end PPE request → approval → issue flow
✓ Change request → approval → document version creation
✓ Record submission → review → approval
```

### Phase 3: Stress & Load Tests - Week 3

#### 3.1 Concurrent Access
```python
✓ Multiple users accessing same document
✓ Concurrent inventory updates
✓ Concurrent PO generation
✓ Race condition tests
✓ Deadlock detection
```

#### 3.2 Load Testing
```python
✓ 100 concurrent login attempts
✓ 1000 documents in database (query performance)
✓ 10,000 PPE records (inventory calculations)
✓ Large file uploads (100MB+)
✓ Pagination performance
```

#### 3.3 Volume Testing
```python
✓ Database with 10,000 users
✓ 50,000 documents
✓ 100,000 PPE issues
✓ Query performance monitoring
```

### Phase 4: Security Tests - Week 4

#### 4.1 Authentication/Authorization
```python
✓ JWT token tampering
✓ Expired token handling
✓ Invalid token handling
✓ Permission bypass attempts
✓ SQL injection attempts
✓ XSS attempts in file uploads
```

#### 4.2 Input Validation
```python
✓ Malformed JSON
✓ Missing required fields
✓ Type mismatches
✓ SQL injection in all inputs
✓ Path traversal in file uploads
✓ Oversized payloads
```

### Phase 5: Edge Cases & Error Handling - Week 5

#### 5.1 Edge Cases
```python
✓ Empty databases (no users, no documents)
✓ Maximum field lengths
✓ Null/None values
✓ Special characters in inputs
✓ Timezone edge cases
✓ Leap year date calculations
✓ Expiry on exact boundary (today)
```

#### 5.2 Error Handling
```python
✓ Database connection loss
✓ File system full
✓ Email service down
✓ External API failures
✓ Out of memory conditions
✓ Disk quota exceeded
```

### Phase 6: Data Integrity Tests - Week 6

#### 6.1 Cascade Operations
```python
✓ User deletion (what happens to their documents/issues?)
✓ Document deletion (workflow history preserved?)
✓ Category deletion (PPE inventory impact?)
✓ Vendor deletion (purchases preserved?)
```

#### 6.2 Transactions
```python
✓ Partial failures rolled back correctly
✓ Inventory updates atomic
✓ Document state changes atomic
```

## Immediate Action Items (Next 48 Hours)

### Priority 1: Critical Path Tests
1. ✅ Authentication (login, lockout, password reset)
2. ✅ Document workflow (all state transitions)
3. ✅ PPE inventory (calculations, concurrent updates)
4. ✅ Permissions (all role-based access)

### Priority 2: Integration Tests
1. ✅ API endpoints (all critical endpoints)
2. ✅ End-to-end workflows
3. ✅ File uploads

### Priority 3: Basic Load Tests
1. ✅ Concurrent logins (100 users)
2. ✅ Document queries (pagination)
3. ✅ Inventory operations

---

## Red Flags Found (Needs Immediate Fix)

### 🔴 CRITICAL
1. **No unique constraint on reset codes** - Could allow duplicate codes
2. **Account lockout doesn't check if duration setting exists** - Could crash
3. **PO number generation has race condition** - Could create duplicates
4. **Inventory update not atomic** - Race condition possible
5. **No file size validation** - Could fill disk
6. **No file type validation** - Security risk

### 🟡 WARNING
1. **Email failures not handled gracefully** - Could break user creation
2. **No pagination on some list endpoints** - Could cause performance issues
3. **No query optimization** - N+1 queries likely
4. **Hardcoded verification URL** - Won't work in production
5. **Password in response** - Security issue (CreateTestUserView)

### 🟢 MINOR
1. **Inconsistent error messages**
2. **Missing docstrings**
3. **Hardcoded constants**

---

## Testing Best Practices

### 1. **Test Naming Convention**
```python
def test_<unit>_<scenario>_<expected_outcome>():
    # Example:
    def test_user_login_with_invalid_password_returns_401():
    def test_document_transition_from_draft_to_hsse_review_succeeds():
    def test_inventory_concurrent_updates_maintains_consistency():
```

### 2. **AAA Pattern** (Arrange, Act, Assert)
```python
def test_account_locks_after_three_failed_attempts():
    # Arrange
    user = create_test_user()
    
    # Act
    for _ in range(3):
        user.record_failed_login()
    
    # Assert
    assert user.is_account_locked()
```

### 3. **Test Independence**
- Each test must be independent
- Use fixtures/factories for test data
- Clean up after each test
- No shared state between tests

### 4. **Test Data Management**
```python
# Use factories, not real data
UserFactory()
DocumentFactory(status='DRAFT')

# Not:
User.objects.create(...)  # Fragile, verbose
```

## Conclusion

**This is a production system with no safety net.** Every deployment is a risk. Every bug could impact safety compliance. We need comprehensive testing **immediately**.

The test suites I'm about to implement will:
1. ✅ Catch bugs before production
2. ✅ Enable confident refactoring
3. ✅ Document expected behavior
4. ✅ Prevent regressions
5. ✅ Improve code quality

**Let's build that safety net now.**
