     - Safety stock (buffer)
   - Formula: `Reorder Point = (Average Monthly Usage √ó Lead Time) + Safety Stock`
   - Example: `(20 boots/month √ó 1 month lead time) + 10 safety = 30 boots`

2. **Regular Stock Audits**
   - Physical count vs system count: Monthly
   - Reconcile discrepancies immediately
   - Investigate variances >5%
   - Update system to match reality

3. **Vendor Management**
   - Maintain 2-3 approved vendors per PPE category
   - Rate vendors after each delivery
   - Review vendor performance quarterly
   - Negotiate better terms with high-volume suppliers

4. **Cost Control**
   - Track spending trends
   - Identify cost reduction opportunities
   - Bulk purchase discounts
   - Compare vendor pricing

**Issuance Management:**

1. **Proper Documentation**

   - Note serial numbers for trackable items
   - Set realistic return dates
   - Include usage location

2. **Return Enforcement**

## Stock Management Strategies

### ABC Analysis

Classify PPE by importance and value:

**Category A (Critical, High Value)**
- Examples: Respirators, Fall Protection, Gas Detectors
- Tight inventory control
- High reorder points
- Multiple vendors
- Monthly reviews

**Category B (Important, Medium Value)**
- Examples: Safety Boots, Hard Hats, Gloves
- Regular inventory control
- Standard reorder points
- 2-3 vendors
- Quarterly reviews

**Category C (Routine, Low Value)**
- Examples: Ear Plugs, Dust Masks, Safety Glasses
- Simple inventory control
- Basic reorder points
- Single vendor acceptable
- Annual reviews

### Reorder Strategies

**Continuous Review:**
- Monitor stock daily
- Reorder when hits reorder point
- Best for high-value or critical PPE

**Periodic Review:**
- Check stock weekly/monthly
- Order based on projected needs
- Best for routine, low-cost PPE

**Just-in-Time (JIT):**
- Order only when needed
- Minimal stock holding
- Requires reliable vendors
- Only for non-critical PPE

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "I don't see Inventory Management in the menu"
**Cause:** You're not an HSSE Manager or Superuser.  
**Solution:** This is a protected feature. Contact your HSSE Manager if you need access.

#### "Cannot issue PPE - insufficient stock"
**Cause:** Stock level is zero or below requested quantity.  
**Solution:**
1. Check Stock Position
2. Create purchase to replenish
3. Or reduce issuance quantity

#### "My request was rejected"
**Cause:** Various reasons (stock unavailable, unjustified need, etc.).  
**Solution:**
- Read rejection reason provided
- Address concerns
- Resubmit if issue resolved

#### "Stock Position shows wrong quantity"
**Cause:** Inventory discrepancy.  
**Solution:** HSSE Manager needs to:
1. Conduct physical count
2. Compare to system
3. Use "Adjust Stock" to correct
4. Document reason for adjustment

#### "Can't upload purchase receipt"
**Cause:** File size or type issue.  
**Solution:**
- Maximum file size: 10MB
- Supported formats: PDF, JPG, PNG
- Compress large files
- Convert to supported format

## Appendix B: Reorder Point Calculations

### Example Calculations

**Safety Boots:**
```
Average Monthly Usage: 15 pairs
Vendor Lead Time: 30 days (1 month)
Safety Stock: 10 pairs (buffer)

Reorder Point = (15 pairs/month √ó 1 month) + 10 pairs
Reorder Point = 25 pairs

Action: When stock reaches 25 pairs, create purchase order
```

**Disposable Gloves:**
```
Average Monthly Usage: 200 pairs
Vendor Lead Time: 14 days (0.5 months)
Safety Stock: 50 pairs

Reorder Point = (200 pairs/month √ó 0.5 months) + 50 pairs
Reorder Point = 150 pairs
```
