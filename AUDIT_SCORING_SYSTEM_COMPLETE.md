## 📊 **Scoring System Design**

### **Three-Level Weighted Scoring:**

```
Question Level:
├─ Each question has weight (e.g., 33.33%, 14.29%, 5.00%)
├─ All questions in a category sum to 100%
└─ Question score based on compliance status:
   • Compliant = 100%
   • OFI = 90%
   • Minor NC = 60%
   • Major NC = 0%
   • N/A = 100% (doesn't affect score)

Category Level:
├─ Category Score = Σ(Question Score × Question Weight)
├─ Each category has weight (e.g., 12.5%, 20%)
├─ All category weights sum to 100%
└─ Color coded: Green (≥80%), Amber (50-79%), Red (<50%)

Overall Audit Score:
├─ Overall = Σ(Category Score × Category Weight)
├─ Grading:
│  • ≥80% = DISTINCTION (Green)
│  • 50-79% = PASS (Amber)
│  • <50% = FAIL (Red)
└─ Visual indicators and progress bars
```

## 🎨 **Example: System Audit Scoring**

### **Category Weights (Equal Distribution):**
```
8 categories × 12.5% each = 100%

1. Leadership & HSSE Culture: 12.5%
2. HSSE Policy & Strategic Objectives: 12.5%
3. Organisation & Responsibilities: 12.5%
4. Risk Management: 12.5%
5. Planning & Procedures: 12.5%
6. Implementation & Monitoring: 12.5%
7. HSE Auditing & Management Review: 12.5%
8. Additional Features: 12.5%
```

### **Question Weights (Example - Category 1):**
```
Category 1 has 3 questions:
• Question 1.1a: 33.33%
• Question 1.1b: 33.33%
• Question 1.1c: 33.33%
Total: 100%
```

### **Score Calculation Example:**
```
Category 1: Leadership & HSSE Culture (Weight: 12.5%)
├─ Q1.1a: Compliant (100%) × 33.33% = 33.33
├─ Q1.1b: Minor NC (60%) × 33.33% = 20.00
├─ Q1.1c: Compliant (100%) × 33.33% = 33.33
└─ Category Score: 86.66%

Category 1 Contribution to Overall:
86.66% × 12.5% = 10.83%

If all categories score similarly:
Overall Score: 10.83% × 8 = 86.64%
Grade: DISTINCTION (Green)
```

## 🔧 **Admin Weight Management**

### **How to Adjust Weights:**

#### **Option 1: Auto-Distribute Equally (Recommended)**
```bash
# Run this command to automatically distribute weights
docker compose exec web python manage.py auto_distribute_weights

Result:
✅ All categories weighted equally
✅ All questions weighted equally within each category
✅ All weights sum to 100%
```

#### **Option 2: Manual Adjustment via Admin**
```
1. Go to: http://localhost:8000/admin/audits/auditchecklistcategory/

2. Click on a category (e.g., "Leadership & HSSE Culture")

3. Adjust weight:
   - Change from 12.5% to 20% (if you want more emphasis)
   
4. Adjust question weights:
   - Important question: 40%
   - Medium question: 30%
   - Minor question: 30%
   - Total must = 100%

5. Save

6. Scores recalculate automatically in frontend!
```

### **Weight Validation:**
```
The system enforces:
✅ All category weights in a template must sum to 100%
✅ All question weights in a category must sum to 100%
✅ Weights between 0-100%
✅ Decimal precision (e.g., 12.50%, 33.33%)
```

---

## 📊 **Current Weight Distribution**

### **System Audit (8 categories):**
```
Each category: 12.50% (8 × 12.5 = 100%)

Category 1: 12.50% (3 questions @ 33.33% each)
Category 2: 12.50% (7 questions @ 14.29% each)
Category 3: 12.50% (21 questions @ 4.76% each)
Category 4: 12.50% (14 questions @ 7.14% each)
Category 5: 12.50% (5 questions @ 20.00% each)
Category 6: 12.50% (20 questions @ 5.00% each)
Category 7: 12.50% (7 questions @ 14.29% each)
Category 8: 12.50% (3 questions @ 33.33% each)

Total: 100.00%
```

### **Other Audits (5 categories each):**
```
Each category: 20.00% (5 × 20 = 100%)
Each question: 33.33% (3 per category)

Total: 100.00%
```

---

## 🚀 **How It Works**

### **User Workflow:**

```
1. Auditor opens "Log Finding" form
2. Selects audit plan
3. Template loads with weights
4. Score card appears (sidebar)
5. Initial score: 100% (all questions default to Compliant)

6. Auditor answers question 1.1a
7. Marks as "Minor NC"
8. Score updates INSTANTLY:
   - Question score: 60% (instead of 100%)
   - Category 1 drops from 100% to ~87%
   - Overall score drops from 100% to ~98.4%
   - Color changes if crosses threshold

9. Continues answering questions
10. Sees real-time score updates
11. Category progress bars update
12. Color coding reflects performance

13. Final submission:
   - Score calculated: 72.5%
   - Grade: PASS (Amber)
   - All scores saved with finding
```

---

## 📈 **Score Calculation Formula**

### **Question Score:**
```
Question Score = Compliance Score × Question Weight

Where Compliance Score:
• Compliant = 100%
• OFI/Observation = 90%
• Minor NC = 60%
• Major NC = 0%
• Not Applicable = 100%
```

### **Category Score:**
```
Category Score = Σ(Question Score × Question Weight) / 100

Example (3 questions):
= (100% × 33.33%) + (60% × 33.33%) + (100% × 33.33%)
= 33.33 + 20.00 + 33.33
= 86.66%
```

### **Overall Audit Score:**
```
Overall Score = Σ(Category Score × Category Weight)

Example (8 categories):
= (86.66% × 12.5%) + (100% × 12.5%) + ... (all 8)
= 10.83 + 12.5 + ...
= 91.25%

Grade: DISTINCTION (Green) 🏆
```

## 📊 **Scoring Examples**

### **Example 1: Leadership Category (3 questions)**
```
Weight: 12.5% of overall

Question 1.1a (33.33%): Compliant (100%)
  → 100 × 33.33% = 33.33

Question 1.1b (33.33%): Minor NC (60%)
  → 60 × 33.33% = 20.00

Question 1.1c (33.33%): Compliant (100%)
  → 100 × 33.33% = 33.33

Category Score: 33.33 + 20.00 + 33.33 = 86.66%
Color: GREEN (≥80%)

Contribution to Overall:
86.66% × 12.5% = 10.83%
```

### **Example 2: Risk Management (14 questions)**
```
Weight: 12.5% of overall

10 questions Compliant (100%)
3 questions OFI (90%)
1 question Minor NC (60%)

Assuming equal weight (7.14% each):
= (10 × 100 × 7.14%) + (3 × 90 × 7.14%) + (1 × 60 × 7.14%)
= 71.4 + 19.28 + 4.28
= 95.0%

Category Score: 95.0%
Color: GREEN (≥80%)

Contribution to Overall:
95.0% × 12.5% = 11.88%
```
