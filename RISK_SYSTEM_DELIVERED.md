## 🎯 **Usage Examples**

### **Example 1: Forklift Operations**
```
Location: Warehouse
Process: Material Handling
Hazard: Moving machinery (PROCESS)
Event: Pedestrian struck by forklift
Causes: Poor visibility, no segregation, excessive speed
Consequences: Serious injury or fatality

Initial Risk: P=4, S=5 → 20 (RED - EXTREME)

Preventive Barriers:
1. Pedestrian walkways (Engineering, Effectiveness=4)
2. Speed limits (Administrative, Effectiveness=3)
3. Forklift licenses (Administrative, Effectiveness=4)

Protective Barriers:
1. Emergency stops (Engineering, Effectiveness=5)
2. First aid trained (Administrative, Effectiveness=3)

Residual Risk: P=2, S=4 → 8 (ORANGE - MEDIUM)

Risk Acceptable: ALARP
ALARP Justification: "Further segregation cost-prohibitive ($500k),
                      relative to residual risk. Weekly monitoring
                      implemented. PPE enforced."

Additional Actions:
1. Install proximity sensors (Engineering, John Smith, Mar 2025)
2. Enhanced training program (Admin, Jane Doe, Feb 2025)
```

Result in Excel:
- All data in 30 columns
- Initial Risk cell: RED background, white text "20"
- Residual Risk cell: ORANGE background, white text "8"
- Professional, audit-ready
