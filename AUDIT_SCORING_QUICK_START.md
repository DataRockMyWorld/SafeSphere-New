## 📈 **Understanding the Math**

### **Simple Example (3 Questions, Equal Weight):**
```
Category: Training (Weight: 20% of overall)

Q1 (33.33%): Compliant = 100% → 33.33
Q2 (33.33%): Compliant = 100% → 33.33
Q3 (33.33%): Minor NC = 60% → 20.00

Category Score: 86.66%
Contribution to Overall: 86.66% × 20% = 17.33%
```

### **Full Audit Example (8 Categories):**
```
Category 1 (12.5%): 86.66% → Contributes 10.83%
Category 2 (12.5%): 100.00% → Contributes 12.50%
Category 3 (12.5%): 75.00% → Contributes 9.38%
Category 4 (12.5%): 90.00% → Contributes 11.25%
Category 5 (12.5%): 100.00% → Contributes 12.50%
Category 6 (12.5%): 80.00% → Contributes 10.00%
Category 7 (12.5%): 100.00% → Contributes 12.50%
Category 8 (12.5%): 100.00% → Contributes 12.50%

Overall Score: 91.46%
Grade: DISTINCTION (Green) 🏆
```

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **Score Not Updating?**
```
Check:
1. Browser console for errors
2. Template has weights set (run auto_distribute_weights)
3. Questions have weights
4. Responses being recorded
```

### **Weights Don't Sum to 100%?**
```
Run: docker compose exec web python manage.py auto_distribute_weights

This auto-fixes all weight distributions
```

### **Score Card Not Showing?**
```
Check:
1. Template loaded (console logs)
2. Questions answered (at least 1)
3. Score Data calculated
4. Browser window wide enough (needs >1200px for sidebar)
```

## ✅ **Verification Checklist**

Run these commands to verify everything:

```bash
# 1. Check scoring criteria
docker compose exec web python manage.py shell -c "
from audits.models import AuditScoringCriteria
print('Scoring Criteria:', AuditScoringCriteria.objects.count())
for sc in AuditScoringCriteria.objects.all():
    print(f'  {sc.display_name}: {sc.score_percentage}%')
"

# 2. Check weights distribution
docker compose exec web python manage.py shell -c "
from audits.models import AuditChecklistTemplate
for t in AuditChecklistTemplate.objects.all()[:2]:
    cat_total = sum(c.weight for c in t.categories.all())
    print(f'{t.name}: Categories sum to {cat_total}%')
"

# 3. Test score calculation
docker compose exec web python manage.py shell -c "
from audits.models import AuditFinding
if AuditFinding.objects.exists():
    f = AuditFinding.objects.first()
    score = f.calculate_overall_score()
    print('Score Data:', score)
